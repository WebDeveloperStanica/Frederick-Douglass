            <h2>Frederick Douglass's Biography</h2>

            <h3>Who was Valentine and his works</h3>        
            <p>Frederick Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, c. February 1817 or 1818
                â€“ February 20, 1895) was an American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer,
                and statesman. After escaping from slavery in Maryland, he became a national leader
                of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, becoming famous
                for his oratory and incisive antislavery writings</p>
            <p>Douglass wrote three autobiographies, describing his experiences as a slave in his 
                "Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave" (1845), which became 
                a bestseller and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition, as was his 
                second book, "My Bondage and My Freedom" (1855). Following the Civil War, Douglass 
                was an active campaigner for the rights of freed slaves and wrote his last 
                autobiography, "Life and Times of Frederick Douglass". First published in 1881 and 
                revised in 1892, three years before his death, the book covers events both during 
                and after the Civil War.</p>  
            <p>Douglass also actively supported women's suffrage, and held several public offices. 
                Without his permission, Douglass became the first African American nominated for
                Vice President of the United States as the running mate and Vice Presidential nominee 
                of Victoria Woodhull, on the Equal Rights Party ticket</p>
            <p>Douglass believed in dialogue and in making alliances across racial and ideological 
                divides, as well as in the liberal values of the U.S. Constitution. When radical 
                abolitionists, under the motto "No Union with Slaveholders", criticized Douglass's 
                willingness to engage in dialogue with slave owners, he replied: "I would unite with 
                anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong</p>
                <h3>Birth place and early life</h3>
                <p>Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey was born into slavery on the Eastern Shore of
                    the Chesapeake Bay in Talbot County, Maryland. The plantation was between Hillsboro
                    and Cordova; his birthplace was likely his grandmother's cabin east of Tappers 
                    Corner, and west of Tuckahoe Creek. In his first autobiography, Douglass stated: 
                    "I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record 
                    containing it." However, based on the extant records of Douglass's former owner, 
                    Aaron Anthony, historian Dickson J. Preston determined that Douglass was born in 
                    February 1818. Though the exact date of his birth is unknown, he chose to celebrate
                    February 14 as his birthday, remembering that his mother called him her
                    "Little Valentine."</p> 
                <h3>Knowledge can give you freedom</h3>
            <p>When Douglass was about 12, Sophia Auld began teaching him the alphabet. 
                Hugh Auld disapproved of the tutoring, feeling that literacy would encourage slaves
                to desire freedom. Douglass later referred to this as the "first decidedly
                antislavery lecture" he had ever heard. "'Very well, thought I,'" wrote Douglass. 
                "'Knowledge unfits a child to be a slave.' I instinctively assented to the proposition, 
                and from that moment I understood the direct pathway from slavery to 
                freedom.</p>
            <p>Under her husband's influence, Sophia came to believe that education and slavery were 
                incompatible and one day snatched a newspaper away from Douglass. She stopped 
                teaching him altogether and hid all potential reading materials, including her Bible, 
                from him. In his autobiography, Douglass related how he learned to read from white 
                children in the neighborhood, and by observing the writings of the men with whom he 
                worked.</p>
            <p>Douglass continued, secretly, to teach himself to read and write. He later often said, 
                "knowledge is the pathway from slavery to freedom." As Douglass began to read 
                newspapers, pamphlets, political materials, and books of every description, this new
                realm of thought led him to question and condemn the institution of slavery. 
                In later years, Douglass credited The Columbian Orator, an anthology that he discovered 
                at about age 12, with clarifying and defining his views on freedom and human rights. 
                First published in 1797, the book is a classroom reader, containing essays, speeches, 
                and dialogues, to assist students in learning reading and grammar. He later learned that 
                his mother had also been literate.</p>
                <h3>From slavery to freedom</h3>
                <p>Valentine wrote about his journey to freedom:  <em>I have often been asked, how I felt
                when first I found myself on free soil. And my readers may 
                share the same curiosity. There is scarcely anything in my experience about which I could not 
                give a more satisfactory answer. A new world had opened upon me. If life is more than breath, 
                and the "quick round of blood," I lived more in one day than in a year of my slave life. It was 
                a time of joyous excitement which words can but tamely describe. In a letter written to a friend 
                soon after reaching New York, I said: "I felt as one might feel upon escape from a den of hungry
                lions." Anguish and grief, like darkness and rain, may be depicted; but gladness and joy, 
                like the rainbow, defy the skill of pen or pencil.</em></p>
                <h3>Autobiography</h3>
                <p>Douglass's best-known work is his first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of 
                Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, written during his time in Lynn, 
                Massachusetts and published in 1845. At the time, some skeptics questioned 
                whether a black man could have produced such an eloquent piece of literature. 
                The book received generally positive reviews and became an immediate bestseller. 
                Within three years, it had been reprinted nine times, with 11,000 copies                    
                circulating in the United States. It was also translated into French and Dutch 
                and published in Europe.
                Douglass published three autobiographies during his lifetime (and revised the 
                third of these), each time expanding on the previous one. The 1845 Narrative 
                was his biggest seller and probably allowed him to raise the funds to gain his 
                legal freedom the following year, as discussed below. In 1855, Douglass published 
                My Bondage and My Freedom. In 1881, in his sixties, Douglass published Life and 
                Times of Frederick Douglass, which he revised in 1892.</p>
                
                <h3>Douglass Portraits</h3>
                <h4>The Most Photographed Man of the 19th Century</h4>
                <p>Frederick Douglass was the most photographed man of the 19th century, sitting for more than
                    160 portraits and photos. He also saw photography as a tool for creating an image of black 
                    manhood in America that was neither funny nor damaging, as many depictions of 
                    African-Americans were at the time. Douglass almost never smiled, an expression he viewed as 
                    too friendly. He was careful to be photographed in settings that emphasized dignity, 
                    accomplishment and power, all things denied to those like him who had been enslaved.</p>
